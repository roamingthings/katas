TelemetrySystem exercise: write the unit tests for the TelemetryDiagnosticControls class.

The responsibility of the TelemetryDiagnosticControls class is to establish a connection to the telemetry server
(through the TelemetryClient), send a diagnostic request and successfully receive the response that contains the
diagnostic info. The TelemetryClient class provided for the exercise fakes the behavior of the real TelemetryClient
class, and can respond with either the diagnostic information or a random sequence. The real TelemetryClient class would
connect and communicate with the telemetry server via tcp/ip.
